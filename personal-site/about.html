        <h2 class="about-header">Chess</h2>
        <p class="about-p">I enjoy the critical thinking aspect and strategizing element that is needed to be successful
            at the game. Thinking 3-5 moves ahead is a difficult challenge, but results in benefits that can positively affect your
            way of thinking in day to day life aside from just the game. Not only is playing chess just an entertaining
            hobby I enjoy, but it has helped me to be more open to different solutions that I would never consider when
            solving a problem.</p>

        <h2 class="about-header">Basketball</h2>
        <p class="about-p">I love to play basketball and watch it especially. Just like chess, I really enjoy the
            strategizing part of basketball and the thinking behind offensive and defensive schemes. You do need physical skills and
            intangibles to be a great basketball player, but without the "being a step ahead" mindset then it will
            definitely be hard to win games. Exercising your mind and body while having fun is something that is very
            important to me and that causes me to be drawn to the joy of basketball.</p>

        <h2 class="about-header">Gaming</h2>
        <p class="about-p">When I want to relax and hang out with some friends, I like to play video games to be able to
            just push aside my worries for some time and enjoy a virtual world. I enjoy playing open world games, such as Legend of
            Zelda and Pokemon, but I do play competitive games to hang out with some friends and compete with each
            other. Gaming has always been apart of my life since I was 5 due to seeing family members always playing on
            a Playstation. That drew my interest into the hobby and I have not let go of it since then.</p>
